## Overview

This server provides AI-ready access to official Indian government statistics through the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It acts as a bridge between AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Cursor, etc.) and MoSPI's open data APIs, enabling natural language queries for economic, demographic, and social indicators.

**Key Features:**
- 25 statistical datasets covering employment, inflation, industrial production, GDP, energy, renewable energy, higher education, school education, gender, health, disability, housing, NSS education consumption, environment, trade, agriculture, consumption, economic census, and digital literacy
- Sequential 4-tool workflow designed for LLM consumption
- Swagger-driven parameter validation
- Full OpenTelemetry integration for observability
- Production-ready Docker deployment

## MCP Tools

The server exposes 4 tools that follow a sequential workflow:

```
list_datasets  ΓåÆ  get_indicators  ΓåÆ  get_metadata  ΓåÆ  get_data
```

| Step | Tool | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 1 | `list_datasets()` | Overview of all datasets. Start here to find the right dataset. |
| 2 | `get_indicators(dataset)` | List available indicators for the chosen dataset. |
| 3 | `get_metadata(dataset, ...)` | Get valid filter values (states, years, categories) and API parameters. |
| 4 | `get_data(dataset, filters)` | Fetch data using filter key-value pairs from metadata. |

**Important:** Tools must be called in order. Skipping `get_metadata` will result in invalid filter codes.

## Quick Start

If you want to connect your AI agent of choice with the MCP server, you can directly connect it with MOSPI's MCP server. Video Guides to connect ChatGPT or Claude to MCP are available here - 

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ec23db03-c5ad-4bdd-af3a-9387bd906b3c

The instructions below are for self-hosting the MCP server.

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/nso-india/esankhyiki-mcp.git
cd esankhyiki-mcp

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Server

```bash
# HTTP transport (remote access)
python mospi_server.py

# OR using FastMCP CLI
fastmcp run mospi_server.py:mcp --transport http --port 8000

# stdio transport (local MCP clients)
fastmcp run mospi_server.py:mcp
```

Server runs at `http://localhost:8000/mcp`

### Connecting from CLI Tools

**Server URL:** `https://mcp.mospi.gov.in/`

#### Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add esankhyiki-mcp --transport http https://mcp.mospi.gov.in/
```

Verify with `claude mcp list`.

#### Cursor / Windsurf

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` or `.windsurf/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "esankhyiki-mcp": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["mcp-remote", "https://mcp.mospi.gov.in/"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### Antigravity

Add to your Antigravity MCP settings:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mospi_api": {
      "serverUrl": "https://mcp.mospi.gov.in/"
    }
  }
}
```

#### Verify Connection

```bash
curl -s -X POST https://mcp.mospi.gov.in/ \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"initialize","params":{"protocolVersion":"2025-03-26","capabilities":{},"clientInfo":{"name":"test","version":"0.1"}}}'
```

A successful response returns `serverInfo` with `"name": "MoSPI Data Server"`.

#### Local Server

If running locally:
```bash
claude mcp add esankhyiki-mcp --transport http http://localhost:8000/mcp
```

Or with the FastMCP Python client:
```python
import asyncio
from fastmcp import Client

async def main():
    async with Client("http://localhost:8000/mcp") as client:
        overview = await client.call_tool("list_datasets", {})
        print(overview)

asyncio.run(main())
```

---

## Deployment

### Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t mospi-mcp .

# Run the container
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 --name mospi-server mospi-mcp
```

### Docker Compose

Includes Jaeger for distributed tracing visualization:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Services:
- **MoSPI Server**: http://localhost:8000/mcp
- **Jaeger UI**: http://localhost:16686

### FastMCP Cloud

1. Push code to GitHub
2. Sign in to [FastMCP Cloud](https://fastmcp.cloud)
3. Create project with entrypoint `mospi_server.py:mcp`

---

Γö£ΓöÇΓöÇ docker-compose.yml       # Full stack with Jaeger

```

### Design Principles

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Swagger as Source of Truth** | API parameters validated against YAML specs in `swagger/`, not hardcoded |
| **Auto-routing** | CPI routes to Group/Item endpoint based on filters; IIP routes to Annual/Monthly |
| **Validation First** | All filters validated before API calls with clear error messages |
| **LLM-Optimized** | Tool docstrings document parameters, return values, and workflow sequence |

---

## Testing

```bash
pip install -r tests/requirements-test.txt
pytest tests/ -v -p no:anyio
```

Runs in-process against the MCP server (no running server needed). Covers all 25 datasets across all 4 tools. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#testing) for details.

## Configuration

Environment variables for OpenTelemetry:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `OTEL_SERVICE_NAME` | Service name in traces | `mospi-mcp-server` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | OTLP collector endpoint | `http://localhost:4317` |
| `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_PROTOCOL` | Protocol (`grpc` or `http/protobuf`) | `grpc` |
